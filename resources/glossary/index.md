<strong>Affective Statements/Questions</strong>: Ways of talking about or inquiring about behavior that describe the feelings the behavior triggered. Affective statements and questions help distinguish the person from the behavior.

<br/><br/>

<strong>Author</strong>: Person(s) whose behavior created harm for a Receiver. Related: Restorative Circle, Receiver
<br/><br/>

<strong>Baseline</strong>: The measure’s agreed starting point. Used for comparing and monitoring growth. Related: Deadline, Population, SMART, Target
<br/><br/>

<strong>Mediation Circle</strong>: A restorative practice where conflict is identified, the Conflictants are identified and connected, and where a restorative agreement is reached to meet the unmet needs revealed by the conflict. Related: Community Circle, Restorative Circle
<br/><br/>

<strong>Community Circle</strong>: A restorative practice used routinely to create connection within a group of participants. Related: Mediation Circle, Restorative Circle
<br/><br/>

<strong>Conflictant</strong>: Person(s) involved in a conflict. Related: Mediation Circle
<br/><br/>

<strong>Deadline</strong>: Date by when the measure will reach the target. Related: Baseline, Population, SMART, Target
<br/><br/>

<strong>Faux Feeling</strong>: An idea about what we think others are. Related: Feeling, Thought
<br/><br/>

<strong>Feeling</strong>: An emotional or physical experience you are having. Related: Faux Feeling, Thought
<br/><br/>

<strong>Interim Goal</strong>: Specific graph-plottable indicators used to determine if the goal is likely to be met or not. Interim goals are SMART (include a baseline, target, population, and deadline), predictive of the goal and influenceable by the RLT. It is recommended that the RLT selects one to three interim goals per goal. Related: Baseline, Deadline, Population, SMART, Target
<br/><br/>

<strong>Harm</strong>: Created when an agreement is broken such that there is now an Author and a Receiver. Related: Author, Receiver
<br/><br/>

<strong>Influenceable</strong>: Suggests that the RLT has authority over roughly 80% of whatever the interim goal is measuring. Related: Interim Goal, Predictive
<br/><br/>

<strong>Interpretation</strong>: An assessment, judgment, or opinion about an observation. Related: Observation
<br/><br/>

<strong>Student-Led Restorative Practices (SLRP)</strong>: The State of Texas’ continuous improvement framework for campuses that choose to be intensely focused on improving student outcomes through implementation of restorative practices. Restorative Leadership Teams (RLTs) that implement the SLRP framework with integrity understand that student outcomes don’t change until adult behaviors change. Starting with me.
<br/><br/>

<strong>Observation</strong>: A noticing of what has measurably happened. Related: Interpretation
<br/><br/>

<strong>Peer Facilitator</strong>: Students who have been trained to lead restorative practices.
<br/><br/>

<strong>Population</strong>: The group of students who will be impacted and/or who are being measured. Related: Baseline, Deadline, SMART, Target
<br/><br/>

<strong>Predictive</strong>: Suggests that there is some evidence of a correlation between the interim goal and the goal. Related: Interim Goal, Influenceable
<br/><br/>

<strong>Receiver</strong>: Person(s) who experienced harm created by an Author. Related: Author, Restorative Circle
<br/><br/>

<strong>Restorative Agreement</strong>: A document signed by all participants that uses SMART goals to describe how, in response to conflict or harm, unmet needs will be met/repaired. Related: Conflict, Harm, SMART
<br/><br/>

<strong>Restorative Circle</strong>: A restorative practice where harm is identified, the Author(s) and Receiver(s) of harm are identified and connected, and where a restorative agreement is reached to repair/meet the unmet needs created by the harm. Related: Author, Community Circle, Mediation Circle, Receiver, Restorative Agreement, Restorative Practice
<br/><br/>

<strong>Restorative Justice</strong>: Any behavior system that utilizes restorative practices as the primary -- and often secondary and tertiary -- tiers of intervention. Related: Restorative Practice
<br/><br/>

<strong>Restorative Practice</strong>: Any individual or community responses to conflict or harm that are focused on repairing/meeting the unmet needs of the individuals and community. When implemented as intended, restorative practices tend to heal trauma. Related: Retributive Practice
<br/><br/>

<strong>Restorative Leadership Team (RLT)</strong>: Group of individuals on a campus or in a district who facilitate restorative practices. Ideally the RLT includes students, staff, and community members.
<br/><br/>

<strong>Retributive Practice</strong>: Any individual or community responses to conflict or harm that are primarily focused on identifying and punishing the creators of conflict or harm. When implemented as intended, retributive practices tend to sustain trauma. Related: Restorative Practice
<br/><br/>

<strong>SMART</strong>: An acronym, generally relating to goal setting, for specific, measurable, attainable, results-focused, and time-bound. To be SMART, goals ideally contain a baseline, a target, a deadline, and a population.  Related: Baseline, Deadline, Population, Target
<br/><br/>

<strong>Target</strong>: The measure’s desired future state. Related: Baseline, Deadline, Population, SMART
<br/><br/>

<strong>Thought (expressed as a feeling)</strong>: An idea about what we think we are. Related: Faux Feeling, Feeling
<br/><br/>

<strong>Trauma</strong>: Created when stress exceeds a person’s external and internal coping resources.
